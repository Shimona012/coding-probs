## Problem

### Repeating Pairs

You are given a string $S$ consisting of lowercase English letters.

For every two adjacent characters in $S$, consider the pair they form. For example, the string `abca` contains the pairs `ab`, `bc`, and `ca`.

A pair is called  **repeating**  if it appears at least twice in the string.

Find the  **number of distinct repeating pairs**  in $S$.

For example, in `ababcabc`, the pair `ab` appears $3$ times and `bc` appears $2$ times, so the answer is $2$.

### Input Format
- The first line contains the string $S$.
### Output Format
- Print a single integer — the number of distinct consecutive character pairs that appear more than once.
### Constraints
- $1 \le |S| \le 10^5$
- $S$ consists only of lowercase English letters.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
ababcabc
```

```
2
```

### Explanation:

The consecutive pairs are:

`ab`, `ba`, `ab`, `bc`, `ca`, `ab`, `bc`

The pair `ab` appears $3$ times and `bc` appears $2$ times.

Therefore, there are  **2**  distinct repeating pairs.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
aaaa
```

```
1
```

### Explanation:

The consecutive pairs are:

`aa`, `aa`, `aa`

Only the pair `aa` appears more than once.

Therefore, the answer is  **1**.

for i in range(len(s)-1):
    string=s[i]+s[i+1]
    existing_count=char_count.setdefault(string,0)
    new_count=existing_count+1
    char_count[string]=new_count
multi=0
for k,v in char_count.items():
    if v>1:
        multi+=1
print(multi)
```
